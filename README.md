Change the owner, group and mode of some files with one command


Requirements
------------

This script uses the operating system commands xargs, chmod, chgrp, and
chmod to do it's work. It also uses the python multiprocessing module from
the standard library which was added in python 2.6, so it won't work with
python versions earlier than that. It won't work in python 3.x.
